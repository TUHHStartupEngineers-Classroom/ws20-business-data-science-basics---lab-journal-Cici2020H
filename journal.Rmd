**Welcome to my page:** Let's have some fun with programming in R.

# Introduction to R

Last compiled: `r Sys.Date()`

Here, we try some basic commands in R.
We can write some mathematical expressions, e.g.
```{r}
10 * 10
99 + 1
2 * 3
4 - 1
6 / (4 - 1)

```

Additionally, we can define some functions. Lets program a function which throw a die....

```{r}
roll <- function(faces = 1:6, nr_of_dices = 1) {
  dice <- sample(faces, size = nr_of_dices, replace = TRUE)
  return(sum(dice)) 
}
# Let's throw the die
sprintf('Let\'s throw the die once: %d',roll())
print(paste('And once again:', roll()))
print(paste('And again:', roll()))
```
I know, this is a lot of fun, but now we want to have a look at the distribution function, so let throw the dice many times and plot the histogram.

```{r}
roll <- function(faces = 1:6, nr_of_dices = 1, probs = c(1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6)) {
  dice <- sample(faces, size = nr_of_dices,prob = probs ,replace = TRUE)
  return(sum(dice)) 
}
# Let's throw the die 10000 times
samples = replicate(n = 100000, roll(), simplify = TRUE)
hist(samples)

```

That is such a nice histogram. 
Now, let's play a game with Roxi, throwing a die three times, who throw the highest sum wins.

```{r}
your_res = roll(nr_of_dices = 3)
roxis_result = roll(nr_of_dices = 3, probs = c(0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.75))
print(paste('Your turn:', your_res))
print(paste('Roxi throw:', roxis_result))
if (roxis_result > your_res) {
  print("Roxi wins, you looser!")
} else if (roxis_result == your_res){
  print("You both win!")
} else {
  print("You win!")
}
```
Roxi wins all the time, lets check the probability distribution function of Roxis die:
```{r} 
samples = replicate(n = 100000, roll(probs = c(0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.75)), simplify = TRUE)
hist(samples)
```

Thus, we see that Roxi uses a loaded die!

# My second post (note the order)

I'm writing this tutorial going from the top down. And, this is how it will be printed. So, notice the second post is second in the list. If you want your most recent post to be at the top, then make a new post starting at the top. If you want the oldest first, do, then keep adding to the bottom

# Adding R stuff

So far this is just a blog where you can write in plain text and serve your writing to a webpage. One of the main purposes of this lab journal is to record your progress learning R. The reason I am asking you to use this process is because you can both make a website, and a lab journal, and learn R all in R-studio. This makes everything really convenient and in the same place. 

So, let's say you are learning how to make a histogram in R. For example, maybe you want to sample 100 numbers from a normal distribution with mean = 0, and standard deviation = 1, and then you want to plot a histogram. You can do this right here by using an r code block, like this:

When you knit this R Markdown document, you will see that the histogram is printed to the page, along with the R code. This document can be set up to hide the R code in the webpage, just delete the comment (hashtag) from the cold folding option in the yaml header up top. For purposes of letting yourself see the code, and me see the code, best to keep it the way that it is. You'll learn that all of these things and more can be customized in each R code block.
